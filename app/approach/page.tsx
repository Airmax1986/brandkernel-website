        <h1>Our Approach: Dialogue, Not Forms</h1>
        <p className="font-bold text-3xl">Traditional branding gives you worksheets. We give you a conversation.</p>
        <p>Most platforms hand you templates and wish you luck. We've built something different: an AI Brand Consultant trained on decades of strategic wisdom, designed to guide you through the deep work most avoid.</p>

          <h2>The BrandKernel Method</h2>
          <div className="space-y-8 mt-4">
            <p><strong>Phase 1: Strategic Excavation</strong><br/>We start where others fear to tread—with the hard questions about who you are and why you exist. Through adaptive dialogue, we uncover the authentic core that's been there all along.</p>
            <p><strong>Phase 2: Position Architecture</strong><br/>Your truth meets market reality. We help you find the unique position where your authentic self creates maximum value. No forcing. No faking. Just strategic alignment.</p>
            <p><strong>Phase 3: Voice Crystallization</strong><br/>Strategy becomes communication. We translate your position into a voice that's unmistakably yours—consistent across every platform, authentic in every interaction.</p>
            <p><strong>Phase 4: Daily Activation</strong><br/>Your Brand Kernel becomes your decision filter. Every piece of content, every client interaction, every strategic choice—all flowing from a single source of truth.</p>

          <h2>Why Dialogue Changes Everything</h2>
          <ul className="space-y-4 mt-4">
            <li>Templates give you someone else's answers. Dialogue helps you find your own.</li>
            <li>Workshops cost thousands and happen once. Our AI Consultant is always available, always consistent.</li>
            <li>Generic questions get generic answers. Adaptive conversation uncovers unique insights.</li>
