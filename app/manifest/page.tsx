        <h1>The BrandKernel Manifesto</h1>
        <p className="font-bold text-3xl">We believe the future belongs to the strategically clear.</p>
        <p>In an economy where attention is currency and authenticity is scarce, only those who know exactly who they are will thrive.</p>
        <p>We reject the template trap. The copy-paste culture. The surface-level solutions that make everyone sound like everyone else.</p>
        <p>We reject the feature race. More tools won't save you. Better tactics won't differentiate you. Another AI assistant won't make you memorable.</p>
        <p>We believe in the deep work. The strategic conversations that reveal who you really are. The uncomfortable questions that unlock breakthrough positioning. The clarity that comes from going beyond the surface.</p>
        <p>We believe every professional—creator, consultant, or founder—has a unique strategic position waiting to be uncovered. Not invented. Not fabricated. Discovered.</p>
        <p>We believe this discovery shouldn't cost $20,000 or take six months. Strategic clarity should be accessible to everyone willing to do the work.</p>
        <p>This is why BrandKernel exists. To democratize the strategic conversation that changes everything.</p>
        <p className="font-bold text-3xl">Your competition is using templates. You're finding your truth.</p>
